My Awesome Art Gallery Project

This project was initially created for a client who is an artist. It was meant to act as a portfolio, landing page, and gallery for her artwork. She later decided she did not feel comfortable posting her work online and decided against the portfolio. I was going to delete it, but I decided to fill in the artwork with freeuse images instead.

How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Depending on how much artwork the artist has I can adjust the pages and amount of art per page. There is an about me page for the artist to present themselves. Each artwork is clickable and if the artist would like The title and a short description of the piece can be added. The artist can also be messaged by viewers who have questions or wish to buy something. This project is all front end so it was created using html, css, and javascript. 


Lessons Learned:

From this project I learned the importance of communication between me and a client. Though our communication about what she wanted out of the website was very clear. I was not aware of her hesitancy of having her work online. I now know to consider more than just the website when consulting with a client.
